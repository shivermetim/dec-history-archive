Richard Cornwell has implemented the PDP6, PDP10-KA, PDP10-KI, PDP10-KL and PDP10-KS simulators. With the differences merely being some device name changes, the PDP10-KS should be compatible with Bob Supnik's original PDP10 simulator.
Dave Bryan has implemented an HP-3000 Series III simulator.
Updated HP2100 simulator from Dave Bryan.
Updated AltairZ80 simulator from Peter Schorn.
Sigma 5, 6 & 7 simulator from Bob Supnik
Beta SAGE-II and PDQ-3 simulators from Holger Veit
Intel Systems 8010 and 8020 simulators from Bill Beech
CDC 1700 simulator from John Forecast
Hans-Ã…ke Lund has implemented an SCELBI (SCientic-ELectronics-BIology) simulator.
IBM 650 simulator from Roberto Sancho Villa
Jim Bevier has implemented a SEL32 simulator.
Updates to the Unibus DUP & Qbus DPV device by Trevor Warwick
Support for Phase V DECnet connections on VAX Unibus and Qbus systems and the addition of support for the DPV11 for Qbus VAX systems.
