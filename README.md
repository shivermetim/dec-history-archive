This collection of Markdown files  is first and foremost a collection for my own interest in the history of DEC. I am not ready for other collaborators should they exist, but if anyone has as obscure an interest as I do, please get in contact. 

Please note I am not a programmer; I have no knowledge of programming or electronic engineering.
